### What I learned

This was really just a quick project to test the water of everything that I have been learning over the last few months. Its fun to watch all the courses and do the exercises, but its another when it comes to the real world. So this is really me just trying out the real world without training wheels and putting it out there for the world to see. Its not much but its a good first step for me. Thanks.
